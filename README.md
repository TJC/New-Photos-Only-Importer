# New-photos-only importer

This is an Android app that I threw together quickly, prior to going on a big holiday.

I wanted a tool that would import photos from an SD-card reader -- but only _new_ photos that hadn't already been brought in. I also wanted them arranged in a folder structure, one folder per day.

This isn't my finest work, and it's missing unit tests entirely.
